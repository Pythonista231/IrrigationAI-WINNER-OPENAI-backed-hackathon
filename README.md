# IrrigationAI-WINNERS
Winner of OPENAI Sponsored EARTH AI Hackathon, before I had even started university - were proud to beat seasoned industry experts including PhDs. 

Included is a back testing software I made which domain experts utilised to assess the quality of results. 

Would have loved to create a proprietary Machine Learning model however the comeptition was OPENAI-backed and therefore given OPENAI credits to use for the hackahton - hence I used GPT4o for the optimal irrigation time calculation as well as GPT4V to test how water stressed a sample plant is before doing so, in order to know how long of a time window is available to optimise on (counterproductive to outline an optimal time 3 days away if the plant only has one day to live).
