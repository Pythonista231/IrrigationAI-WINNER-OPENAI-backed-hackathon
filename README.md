# IrrigationAI-WINNERS
Winner of OPENAI Sponsored EARTH AI Hackathon, before I had even started university - were proud to beat seasoned industry experts including PhDs. 

Included is a back testing software I made which domain experts utilised to assess the quality of results. 

Would have loved to create a proprietary Machine Learning model however it was very time pressured (24h) + the comeptition was OPENAI-backed so figured it would be preferable to employe their outstanding services.
