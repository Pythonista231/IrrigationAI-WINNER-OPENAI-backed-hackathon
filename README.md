# IrrigationAI-WINNERS
Winner of OPENAI Sponsored EARTH AI Hackathon, before I had even started university - were proud to beat seasoned industry experts including PhDs. 

Included is a back testing software I made which domain experts utilised to assess the quality of results. 

Would have loved to create a proprietary Machine Learning model however the competition was OPENAI-backed and therefore given OPENAI credits to use for the hackathon - hence I used GPT4o for the optimal irrigation time calculation.
